# NCU Transfer Web
**NCU MIS Web Programming Project**  
*By Hsin Ni Liao and other four team members from NCU MIS*  
*June 2024*
## Introduction
This website is for students who want to transfer to a different department at NCU and for students from other schools who wish to transfer to NCU. We have gathered all the necessary information and provided a platform for them to share their experiences. We use generative AI to generate emails, allowing users to request a course enrollment code from professors. This makes the process more convenient, especially for students transferring between departments or from other universities.
